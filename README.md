# KATLENDAR Project

README

Welcome to the KATlendar Project! This is a project that was created in college within a four person group. We designed and developed a user friendly calendar application, allowing users to efficiently manage events that are within Sam Houston State. We implemented firebase API's real-time database capabilities to create a login/signup system.
